**Task**

You need to develop a prototype system that analyzes statistical data on freelancer incomes and provides answers to natural language queries. For this, use the dataset available at the link: [Freelancer Earnings and Job Trends](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shohinurpervezshohan/freelancer-earnings-and-job-trends?select=freelancer_earnings_bd.csv).

Your system should be able to process queries and provide answers. Here are a few examples of questions it should answer:

*   How much higher is the income of freelancers who accept payment in cryptocurrency compared to other payment methods?
*   How is freelancer income distributed based on their region of residence?
*   What percentage of freelancers who consider themselves experts have completed fewer than 100 projects?

Come up with additional questions of a similar nature to demonstrate the solution.

**Technical requirements**

*   Implement the system with a command-line interface.
*   Integrate a Large Language Model (LLM) of your choice, but the full dataset cannot be directly loaded into it.
*   Any stack and LLM.
